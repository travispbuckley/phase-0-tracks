#1 Look up instructional videos
	-basic turorial for jquery
	-Starting with a basic tutorial will expose me to jquery and what exactly it will do.
#2 Think of ways to make a project using the information i learn
#3 Make a project using jquery
	-I still don't know what it is, but that will come with the tutorials. Then i can decide what i want to make.
#4 I think testing what i learn is important, however most of that can hold off until i start to create my own project. I can refer back to my learning material if need be.
#5 I'll take a break halfway in between (after 1 hour) to make sure im understanding everything, and to make sure i retained all the info before i go on to another hour of learning.
