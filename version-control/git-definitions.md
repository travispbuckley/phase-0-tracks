# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows for all of the changes and revisions that were made to a file to be recorded, dated, noted, etc. These can then be merged to update the master file with the changes you want/want to remove.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an exact copy of the master file you're working on. They are essential because when you are making changes, whether it be adding a feature, fixing an error for a perticular section, or just updating some text information, you don't want to make changes to the master copy. This is because what if an error, is made, or the code you add has an error and causes another part of the file to not work. This would essentially destroy your whole file since you wouldn't know how to go back, or where to go back to fix things if multiple changes  were made. When you use a branch to change or add a specific function, you can see if that function you added works. When you know it is error free, you can then merge that to your master knowing there will be no issues.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a change made to a file that you are working on. It is saving the information you updated. You want to encorporate an appropriate message anytime you make a saved change to the file you're working on. This would including a short description of what you added, that way when looking back at all the previous commits, you can know where and and what time you made a specific change. This is very useful in finding and fixing errors, because you can see when your code worked, and what changed when it eventually had the error. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is something that occurs when you try merging a branch that you have modified into the branch that you originally started with. The reason a conflict would occur, is that somoething happened to the original, and is now slightly different than the copy you were working with (minus the changes you actually made, though). So for example, the original had a file deleted, or lines deleted, modified, etc, that you didn't already have in your branched copy. So when you go to merge, there is something else different besides the pieces you were intentionally adding. This causes a conflict, and must be addressed before being able to continue.
